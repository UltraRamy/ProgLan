## Reflection 1

I've used several clean code principles in implementing my edit and delete feature. I used meaningful names for my functions and variables. I also wrote them clear enough to the point I can understand the code without any comments reminding me. I tried my best to apply the right object and data structure. Some errors have also been handled, although some others have not. For security principle, I used id as a way to authenticate a request to a certain object. However, I have not implemented enough entropy to the id attribute. To improve my code, I can implement a more holistic error handling and implement an id with more entropy.
